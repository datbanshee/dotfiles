Dotfiles
========

All my dotfiles I currently use. 

Usage
-----

I haven't made any scripts yet. So the installation process contains few steps:

1. download this repo;
2. link all symlink files.

To symlink files use:

>> ln -s dotfiles/zsh/zshrc.symlink .zshrc

TODO
----

* Create dotfiles for vim;
* Create script that will automate installing process.
